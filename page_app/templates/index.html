        <h4>MY PERSONAL STORY...</h4>
        <p class="lower-p"><span class="lower-span">I</span> am a typical Southern Califonia native, now living as a transplant in Colorado. As a kid I grew up surfing, enjoying beachside bonfires, and I used my skateboard as my means of transportation.</p> 
        <br>
        <p class="lower-p">After graduating high school, I became an Emergecny Medical Technician, and completed a fire academy. I have since spent the past 14 years as a first responder. When I wasn't working, I used to spend my time weightlifting, rock climbing, fishing, and and backpacking, occassionally tackling the summit of a 14er.</p>
        <br> 
        <p class="lower-p">More recently, however, I became a father of the best, but most difficult little boy I can imagine. Now my free time consists of fuelling my coffee addiction to overcome my exhaustion, and making sure I give my son, Jax, the best life possible. Our days generally involve a park visit, a bike ride, playtime with problem solving toys, and Jax stealing my food, because his is apparently never good enough. I am transitioning out of my role as a first responder, so I can provide a better life for my family.</P>

<!-- I BEGAN WITH FREE RESOURCES, PAID RESOURCES, AND EVENTUALLY STUMBLED INTO AN ONLINE CODING SCHOOL. WHILE ATTENDING CODING DOJO I RAPDILY INCREASED MY KNOWLEDGE OF WEB DEVELOPMENT FASTER THAN I EVER COULD ON MY OWN. AT CODING DOJO I ENROLLED IN FRONT END DEVELOPMENT, THEN SUPPLEMENTED THIS KNOWLEDGE WITH DJANGO, HOWEVER, THE BEST SKILL I ACQUIRED AT CODING DOJO WAS LEARNING INDEPENDANCE IN FINDING ANSWERS. ALTHOUGH I AM NO EXPERT, I AM A MOTIVATED AND SELF SUFFICIENT JUNIOR DEVELOPER. BELOW YOU WILL FIND SEVERAL OF MY PROJECTS WHICH SHOWCASE SOME OF MY WORK. -->
